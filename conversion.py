print("Speed:", kmh, "KM/H = ", mph, "MPH")
# from what I can see it will convert MPH to KMH and vice versa
# kind of hard to figure out what the MPH and KMH but context clues such as speed help
# one thing that has me confused are we the ones to put a value at the second line of code or are we just looking at it and predict what it will do
# on further inspection it seems to be formula or something so lets say you input 100
# Jose Diaz
# 9/28/23
# in the end it will print out speed: 100 KM/H = 62.14 MPH
